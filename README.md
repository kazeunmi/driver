# Learn by Doing Linux Device Driver

Details are skipped intentionally because I want to help you only to make things working.
I trust you do the rest.

Examples are kept very short for the same reason. However, each example is a complete program.
Details, error checking in particular, are omitted for simplicity. 

For the C source code, I used 4 spaces for indentation to increase text density.
For your production code, use tab for indentation as it is the rule in the Linux kernel source.
